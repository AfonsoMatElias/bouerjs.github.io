      <h3> <a id="what"> What is Bouer.js? </a> </h3>
      <p>
        Is a javascript library for building user interfaces, and helps in the
        web applications development, providing a synchronous interaction
        between user interfaces and Javascript data.
      </p>

      <h3> <a id="why"> So, Why Bouer.js? </a> </h3>
      <p>
        As the name says, it is a javascript library really easy to use that provides
        to you a simple way to interact with your HTML by using Reactive Properties,
        Scoping data in the HTML, reusable components written in pure HTML,
        api calls using only attributes, and so on... It's very good and simple to
        build Single Page Application. No Virtual DOM is used, it uses the Real
        DOM to handle all the data changes.
      </p>

      <h3> <a id="compatibility"> Browsers Compatibility </a> </h3>
      <p>

      </p>
